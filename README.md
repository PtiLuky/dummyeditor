# DummyRPG - Editor

Welcome to DummyRPG project!

In this project you'll find:
* a simple 2D RPG game engine and its player  (https://github.com/PtiLuky/dummyRPG)
* an editor to create games for this editor ! (this repository)

The editor:
![Screenshot Editor](docs/screenshot-editor.png "Screenshot Editor")

And a game preview:
![Screenshot Player](docs/screenshot-player.png "Screenshot Player")


## Current state

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

* [x] Draw a map, a floor
* [ ] Set the position of the player
* [ ] Create the Non-player characters
* [ ] Create dialogs with NPC
* [ ] Spawn monsters
* [ ] Fights monsters
* [ ] Items management

Note: Player Client may be more avanced than the Editor. That'd mean that some functionnalities are
available in the client (let's say dialogs) but a game using them cannot be make
from this Editor yet.
